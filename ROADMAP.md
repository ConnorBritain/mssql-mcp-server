# SQL Server MCP – Enterprise Roadmap

This roadmap focuses on making the SQL Server MCP server production-ready for enterprise use, especially in environments with many client databases, strict security, and complex networking.

Each item is roughly ranked by **Value-Add (V)**, **Complexity (C)**, **Feasibility (F)**, and **Market Relevance (M)** on a 1–5 scale (5 = highest). Overall priority is based primarily on V + M, then adjusted by C and F. We now also track **Status** (✅ implemented, 🚧 partially implemented, ⛔ not started) so the roadmap reflects what already ships in this repo.

Scoring legend:

- **V** – How much this helps real-world enterprise workflows (RDP reduction, fewer prod incidents, faster support).
- **C** – Implementation complexity (higher = harder / more effort).
- **F** – Feasibility given typical stack / infra (higher = easier / more realistic near-term).
- **M** – How many orgs are likely to care (breadth of applicability).

## Architecture Milestone: Core Extraction Complete (v0.5.0)

As of February 2026, all shared logic has been extracted into **`mssql-mcp-core` (v0.2.0)**, a dedicated shared library. The three tier packages are now thin wrappers (~12 lines each) that call `startMcpServer({ tier })`.

**4-repo architecture:**

| Repo | npm Package | Role |
|------|-------------|------|
| `mssql-mcp-core` | `@connorbritain/mssql-mcp-core` | All tools, EnvironmentManager, AuditLogger, SecretResolver, IntentRouter, wrapToolRun, createMcpServer, toolsets |
| `mssql-mcp-reader` | `@connorbritain/mssql-mcp-reader` | Thin wrapper — `startMcpServer({ tier: "reader" })` |
| `mssql-mcp-writer` | `@connorbritain/mssql-mcp-writer` | Thin wrapper — `startMcpServer({ tier: "writer" })` |
| `mssql-mcp-server` | `@connorbritain/mssql-mcp-server` | Thin wrapper — `startMcpServer({ tier: "admin" })` |

This provides the compile-time tier guarantees described in the Governance Roadmap while keeping all logic in one maintained codebase. Remaining work items below are annotated with which repo they belong to.

---

## 1. Core, Safe Querying & Connection Management (Top Priority)

### 1.1. Environment / Connection Profiles

- **Description**: Named environments like `client_foo_prod`, `client_bar_stage`, `internal_dev` with connection strings, auth mode, default database/schema, and safety flags.
- **Why**: Mirrors how DBAs/support already think about fleets of SQL Servers; provides a single abstraction for everything else.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – EnvironmentManager supports JSON config files with named environments (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/config/EnvironmentManager.ts#1-250). Falls back to env vars for single-DB mode. Tools accept optional `environment` parameter to select target. Example config at @environments.example.json. Configure via ENVIRONMENTS_CONFIG_PATH env var.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Config-driven list of environments (JSON format).
  - ✅ Per-environment: server, database, port, auth mode, read-only vs read/write, allowed tools.
  - ✅ Ability to select environment per MCP request via `environment` parameter.
- **Score**: V=5, C=2, F=5, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P0**

### 1.2. Read-Only Query Tools (Guardrailed)

- **Description**: Tools for safe, constrained `SELECT` operations, always enforcing limits.
- **Why**: 90% of support/triage is reading data. Read-only with enforced `TOP n` is low-risk, high-value, and broadly useful.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `read_data` enforces SELECT-only queries with keyword/pattern blocking, result sanitization, and automatic row limiting via MAX_ROWS_DEFAULT env var (default 1000, configurable 1-100k) (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/ReadDataTool.ts#1-299). Queries without TOP/LIMIT are auto-limited.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - `execute_readonly_sql` with hard-coded safeguards (e.g., automatic `TOP 1000` if none specified, configurable).
  - Helper tools: `get_table_sample`, `describe_table`, `search_tables`, `search_columns`.
  - Schema-aware typing in responses (useful for agents).
- **Score**: V=5, C=3, F=5, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P0**

### 1.3. Secrets & Credential Management Integration

- **Description**: Connect to SQL via connection strings that pull credentials from secure stores instead of plain text.
- **Why**: Non-starter for most enterprises if credentials are in config files or editor settings.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – Pluggable `SecretResolver` with configurable provider chain (`env`, `dotenv`, `file`). `${secret:NAME}` placeholders in environment configs resolve through ordered providers. `validate_environment_config` checks provider health and secret resolvability.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Support for environment-variable-based secrets via `${secret:NAME}` syntax.
  - ✅ Pluggable provider system: `env` (process.env), `dotenv` (reads .env files directly), `file` (reads named files from a directory).
  - ✅ Provider chain configured via `secrets.providers` in environments.json; first match wins.
  - ✅ `DOTENV_PATH` env var fallback for zero-config .env support.
  - ✅ `validate_environment_config` validates provider configs and reports unresolvable secrets.
  - ✅ Async vault providers: Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault (core v0.2.0).
  - ✅ Secret TTL / credential rotation with automatic background refresh and stale pool invalidation (core v0.2.0).
  - ✅ Clear guidance/README on NOT checking secrets into the repo.
- **Score**: V=5, C=3, F=4, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P0** ✅ **Complete**

### 1.4. Basic Audit Logging (Per Command)

- **Description**: Minimal audit log of every MCP tool invocation that touches SQL.
- **Why**: Enterprises need to know who ran what, where, and when. Even a simple log file is a huge step up.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – all tool invocations are logged to JSON Lines format with timestamp, tool name, environment, arguments (redacted), result status, and duration. Per-environment `auditLevel` controls verbosity: `none`, `basic`, or `verbose`.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Log entries including: timestamp, environment, tool name, and SQL (with parameters, optionally redacted).
  - ✅ Per-environment audit level configuration (`auditLevel`: none/basic/verbose).
  - ✅ Verbose mode logs full arguments and truncated result data.
  - 🚧 Pluggable log sinks (start with file-based logs; later SIEM/cloud sinks).
- **Score**: V=5, C=3, F=4, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P0–P1** ✅ **Complete**

### 1.5. Intelligent Tool Routing & Multi-DB Selection

- **Description**: Add an intent-routing layer that selects the correct MCP tool (read vs. write vs. metadata) and the right database profile before executing, reducing "read_data everywhere" behavior.
- **Why**: Greatly improves UX and safety, especially once configs support multiple databases or tenants. Aligns SQL MCP with the natural-language precision seen in Atlassian/Supabase MCP servers.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – IntentRouter infers environments from natural language prompts ("show tables in prod", "query staging"), selects appropriate tools based on intent/keywords, and gates mutations with confirmation. Now also supports server-level access for multi-database environments.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Intent classifier (heuristics) that maps prompts to tool sequences (schema discovery, safe updates, audits, etc.).
  - ✅ Metadata-rich tool registry (side effects, requirements) so routing can reason about options.
  - ✅ Environment selector that chooses the correct connection profile from prompts when multiple databases are configured.
  - ✅ Server-level multi-database access via `accessLevel: "server"` with `allowedDatabases`/`deniedDatabases` filtering.
  - ✅ `list_databases` tool for discovering databases on server-level environments.
  - ✅ `list_environments` tool for discovering configured environments.
  - ✅ Optional `database` parameter on `read_data`, `list_tables`, `describe_table` for cross-database queries.
  - ⛔ Telemetry loop to learn from mis-routed calls.
- **Score**: V=5, C=4, F=4, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P0** ✅ **Complete**

---

## 2. Safe Write Operations & Change Guardrails

### 2.1. Structured Safe-Update Tool(s)

- **Description**: Tools for performing `UPDATE`/`DELETE` with baked-in safety checks and previews.
- **Why**: Biggest risk in prod is accidental destructive write queries (missing `WHERE`, wrong environment). Guardrails are where MCP can shine.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `update_data` and `delete_data` enforce required `WHERE` clauses, provide automatic preview of affected rows (TOP 10), row-count limits (default 1000, configurable via `maxRows`), and require explicit confirmation (`confirmUpdate`/`confirmDelete`) before execution (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/UpdateDataTool.ts, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/DeleteDataTool.ts).
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Automatic `SELECT` preview of rows that will be updated/deleted.
  - ✅ Disallow `UPDATE`/`DELETE` without `WHERE`, configurable thresholds for affected rows.
  - ⛔ Transactional behavior: `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, preview, then explicit commit/rollback (not yet implemented).
- **Score**: V=5, C=4, F=4, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P1**

### 2.2. Named / Template-Based Scripts

- **Description**: Library of parameterized, reviewed SQL scripts for common operations, exposed as MCP tools.
- **Why**: Real data fixes are often repeatable playbooks; templating them increases safety and speed.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `list_scripts` and `run_script` tools with full governance controls (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/ListScriptsTool.ts, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/RunScriptTool.ts, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/config/ScriptManager.ts).
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Scripts stored in configurable directory with `scripts.json` manifest.
  - ✅ `list_scripts` tool to discover available scripts with filtering by environment and tier.
  - ✅ `run_script(name, parameters)` with parameterized query execution.
  - ✅ Preview mode (`preview: true`) shows resolved SQL without execution.
  - ✅ Per-script governance: `tier`, `requiresApproval`, `readonly`, `allowedEnvironments`, `deniedEnvironments`.
  - ✅ Environment-aware: scripts respect `requireApproval` and `readonly` environment policies.
- **Score**: V=4, C=3, F=4, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P1** ✅ **Complete**

### 2.3. Dry-Run / Plan-Only Execution

- **Description**: Tool that executes `SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON` or equivalent to preview execution plan/row estimates without modifying data.
- **Why**: Lets users/agents see if a query is dangerous or heavy before running it in prod.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `explain_query` generates estimated execution plans via SHOWPLAN, with optional XML output and natural-language-environment routing (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/ExplainQueryTool.ts, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/index.ts#553-567).
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ `explain_query(sql)` that returns plan + estimated row counts.
  - ⛔ Integration into safe-update tools as a pre-step (still pending).
- **Score**: V=4, C=3, F=4, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P1–P2**

---

## 3. Authentication & Network Topologies

### 3.1. SQL Authentication Support (Baseline)

- **Description**: Allow connection strings using SQL username/password, supplied securely.
- **Why**: Many orgs still use SQL auth, especially cross-domain or legacy.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – Node server supports `SQL_AUTH_MODE=sql` with `SQL_USERNAME`/`SQL_PASSWORD` env vars and constructs the connection accordingly (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/index.ts#37-74, @README.md#88-144).
- **Key capabilities**:
  - Clear schema for environment configs that include `User ID` / `Password` from env vars.
  - Connection pooling & robust error handling.
- **Score**: V=4, C=2, F=5, M=4 → **Overall Priority: Complete (already shipped)**

### 3.2. Integrated / Windows Authentication (On-Prem)

- **Description**: Support Windows/AD integrated security from domain-joined machines or service accounts.
- **Why**: Critical for many on-prem enterprises that forbid SQL auth in prod.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – NTLM-based Windows authentication is available when `SQL_AUTH_MODE=windows` with optional `SQL_DOMAIN` (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/index.ts#76-107, @README.md#88-147).

  - Documentation for running MCP as a domain user on a bastion/jump host.
- **Score**: V=5, C=4, F=3, M=5 → **Overall Priority: Complete (already shipped)**

### 3.3. Azure AD / Cloud Identity Integration

- **Description**: Use AAD tokens or managed identities to connect to Azure SQL / SQL Managed Instance.
- **Why**: Must-have for cloud-first shops; reduces password management.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – default auth path acquires an Azure AD access token via `InteractiveBrowserCredential` (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/index.ts#109-138, @README.md#118-128).
- **Key capabilities**:
  - Token acquisition (MSAL or equivalent) in the MCP server.
  - Environment-level config for AAD auth.
- **Score**: V=4, C=4, F=3, M=4 → **Overall Priority: Complete (already shipped)**

### 3.4. Deployment & Bastion Patterns

- **Description**: Opinionated docs + scripts for running the MCP server locally, containerized, or on bastion/jump hosts that can reach production SQL.
- **Why**: Reduces friction in adopting the server in enterprise networks; replaces the "RDP + SSMS" ritual with a documented MCP deployment.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `DEPLOYMENT.md` covers five deployment patterns (direct, VPN, SSH tunnel, jump host, Docker/container), systemd service setup, security hardening checklist, multi-client fleet topology, and troubleshooting guide.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Reference architectures: local (VPN), container, jump host, managed service.
  - ✅ Security guidance (ports, SSL, credential scope, service accounts).
  - ✅ Optional scripts/manifests (systemd unit, Dockerfile, Docker Compose).
- **Score**: V=4, C=2, F=5, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P1** ✅ **Complete**

---

## 4. Observability, Audit, and Compliance

### 4.2. Session / Change History Views

- **Description**: Tools to query recent actions by user/environment (e.g., “what did we run for this client last week?”).
- **Why**: Drastically improves post-incident analysis and knowledge transfer.
- **Status**: ⛔ Not started – requires the audit log foundation plus dedicated MCP tools; neither exist yet.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - MCP tools to query the audit log storage.
  - Filters by environment, user, time range, and tool.
- **Score**: V=4, C=3, F=4, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P2–P3**

---

## 5. Schema & Metadata Intelligence

### 5.1. Schema Discovery & Search Tools

- **Description**: Tools to explore databases: list tables, columns, FKs, indexes; search by name pattern.
- **Why**: Crucial in large, multi-tenant or legacy schemas where nobody remembers the exact table/column names.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `list_table`, `search_schema`, `describe_table`, `profile_table`, and `inspect_relationships` already cover structured discovery with pagination, fuzzy matches, and profiling (@README.md#24-41, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/ListTableTool.ts#4-44, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/SearchSchemaTool.ts#1-300, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/ProfileTableTool.ts#1-400, @MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/RelationshipInspectorTool.ts#1-214).

  - Include schema, data types, nullable flags.
- **Score**: V=4, C=3, F=5, M=5 → **Overall Priority: Complete (already shipped)**

### 5.2. Dependency / Reference Tools

- **Description**: Find where a table/column is referenced (FKs, views, procedures).
- **Why**: Helps assess impact of changes and understand data flow.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `inspect_relationships` returns FK mappings; new `inspect_dependencies` tool uses `sys.sql_expression_dependencies` to find all referencing objects (@MssqlMcp/Node/src/tools/InspectDependenciesTool.ts).
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ `inspect_relationships` for FK relationships (inbound/outbound).
  - ✅ `inspect_dependencies` for full dependency analysis:
    - Objects that reference a table/view (views, stored procedures, functions, triggers, foreign keys).
    - Objects that the target references (tables, views, functions).
    - Impact analysis hint when dependents exist.
  - ✅ Categorized output by object type for easy consumption.
- **Score**: V=4, C=4, F=4, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P2** ✅ **Complete**

### 5.3. Schema Drift & Version Awareness

- **Description**: Compare live schema to an expected model (e.g., from migrations) and report differences.
- **Why**: Detects drift across many client DBs; essential for consistent behavior.
- **Status**: ⛔ Not started – no schema snapshot tooling or migration metadata integration exists.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - Configurable expected schema snapshot or migration metadata.
  - Tools like `check_schema_drift(environment)`.
- **Score**: V=3, C=4, F=3, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P3**

---

## 6. Multi-Tenant & Client-Centric Features

### 6.1. Per-Client Scoping & Safety

- **Description**: Encode tenant/client concepts into tools so queries are always scoped to the right customer.
- **Why**: Reduces risk of leaking or modifying data across clients; matches real-world workflows ("fix data for Client X").
- **Status**: ⛔ Not started – environments are single-target and tools accept arbitrary SQL without tenant scoping helpers.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - Environment profiles that bind to a specific client DB or schema.
  - Tools that require a `client_id` and automatically add appropriate filters.
- **Score**: V=4, C=4, F=4, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P2**

### 6.2. Per-Client / Per-Environment Policy Controls

- **Description**: Policy layer that determines which tools and operations are allowed per environment/client.
- **Why**: Some clients/environments may prohibit certain actions (bulk export, arbitrary updates).
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – Comprehensive per-environment policy system with centralized enforcement in `wrapToolRun`.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ Configurable policy per environment: read-only vs read-write, allowed tool list, row-limit overrides.
  - ✅ Central enforcement so individual tools don't duplicate checks.
  - ✅ `allowedTools` / `deniedTools` for tool whitelisting/blacklisting.
  - ✅ `allowedSchemas` / `deniedSchemas` with wildcard pattern matching.
  - ✅ `maxRowsDefault` enforcement (environment cap overrides user requests).
  - ✅ `requireApproval` for mandatory confirmation on all operations.
  - ✅ `auditLevel` per-environment (`none`, `basic`, `verbose`).
- **Score**: V=4, C=4, F=3, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P2–P3** ✅ **Complete**

---

## 7. Developer Experience & Operations

### 7.1. Configuration Validation & Health Checks

- **Description**: Tools for verifying that environments are configured correctly and reachable.
- **Why**: Faster setup/onboarding; avoids confusing runtime errors. High leverage when juggling many client databases because you can validate reachability before running real queries.
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented – `test_connection` verifies connectivity, latency, and server metadata. `validate_environment_config` checks config structure, provider health, and secret resolvability.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - ✅ `validate_environment_config` tool — validates config schema, provider configs, and reports unresolvable secrets.
  - ✅ `test_connection(environment)` — runs a simple query and returns latency + status.
- **Score**: V=4, C=3, F=5, M=5 → **Overall Priority: P1** ✅ **Complete**

### 7.2. Example Workflows / Playbooks

- **Description**: Documented workflows (or scripts) showing how to perform common DBA/support tasks via MCP instead of SSMS/RDP.
- **Why**: Helps teams migrate real work from RDP+SSMS to this stack.
- **Status**: ⛔ Not started – README lists capabilities but does not walk through end-to-end support scenarios or repeatable playbooks.
- **Key capabilities**:
  - Step-by-step examples (e.g., "investigate a patient record", "fix bad claim codes").
  - Potentially paired with named scripts and safe-update tools.
- **Score**: V=3, C=2, F=5, M=4 → **Overall Priority: P2–P3**

   - ⛔ Centralized MCP management tooling.

---

## 10. Remote Access Patterns

MCP servers run locally on the client machine as child processes of the IDE (Windsurf, Claude Desktop, VS Code). They communicate via stdio, not network sockets. This creates challenges for environments where SQL Server is only reachable through jump hosts or RDP sessions.

### Current Options

**Option A: Install MCP client on jump host (recommended for now)**
RDP to the jump host, install Windsurf/Claude Desktop there, configure the MCP server. The server runs locally on the jump host and can reach SQL Server directly.

**Option B: SSH tunnel (if available)**
If SSH access exists to the jump host, tunnel SQL traffic:
```bash
ssh -L 1433:sql-server:1433 user@jump-host
```
Then configure MCP to connect to `localhost:1433`. Traffic tunnels through SSH.

**Option C: VPN with database port access**
Some VPN configurations allow direct database access. Check with client IT if port 1433 is routable.

### Future: Remote MCP Proxy (exploratory)

A potential architecture for enterprise scenarios where installing tools on jump hosts isn't feasible:

```
┌─────────────┐         HTTPS/WSS        ┌─────────────────┐       TCP 1433      ┌────────────┐
│  Windsurf   │◄────────────────────────►│  MCP Proxy      │◄───────────────────►│ SQL Server │
│  (local)    │                          │  (on jump host) │                     │            │
└─────────────┘                          └─────────────────┘                     └────────────┘
```

The proxy would:
- Run on the jump host as a lightweight service
- Expose MCP protocol over WebSocket or HTTP
- Handle authentication and connection pooling
- Allow local IDEs to connect to remote MCP servers

This could evolve into a **centralized MCP management platform** - a potential product avenue for enterprises managing multiple database environments, jump hosts, and access policies from a single control plane.

**Status:** Exploratory. The MCP SDK supports custom transports, making this technically feasible. Prioritization depends on demand.
